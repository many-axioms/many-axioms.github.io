# AI thoughts - omne

*Disclaimer: I am not an AI expert. Rather, I am a high school student who messes AI as a hobby. Whatever I say here is
representative of my opinion, which could be totally wrong.

The rise of ChatGPT in late 2022 brought AI into prominence amongst the general population.

- The basic idea
 - Multiple views of AI, from anti-technology to accelerationist
 - Anti-technology: Safety behind, dangers ahead
 - Accelerationist: Dangers behind, safety ahead
 - The Omne view
  - There are dangers inherent to not advancing technology. We're little things trapped in our flesh prisons with
    expiry dates on them, hurtling around a ball of flaming hydrogen that will eventually expand and consume our home
    planet, which could also suffer from things like asteroid bombardments.
    We will die, the Earth will die, the Sun will die. But for all of us who don't want to die, how can we not die?
  - On the other hand, there are dangers ahead, too. A hostile AI could take over humanity and kill humans. It could
    strip humanity of agency, placing it at the top of the natural hierarchy, just as we are currently above the
    animals we keep as pets, or in farms and zoos?
    Do we want to end up in farms and zoos, or as the pets of superior beings?
  - Dangers behind, and a path to safety ahead. But also many paths ahead that lead us to dangers.
- High costs to delaying technology
- AI is unique among our technologies because it is agentic
- Accelerate, but stay cautious
- Biotech-infotech merger
