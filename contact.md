# contact - omne

Please respect my time when reaching out. I prioritize self-improvement over engaging in trivial conversations. If I don't respond to you, there is a reason.

## Email

You can reach me at many-axioms at outlook dot com.

- If we're on good terms, I'll typically respond within a week.
- Otherwise, expect a response within a week, provided your email is interesting and of value.
- Responses may take up to a month if I am busy.
- Do not resend an email with identical content if I did not respond to your email, but you are welcome to try again with different content.
- If you're unsure about emailing, err on the side of sending.

## Social media

I do not have accounts on any mainstream social media platforms. Any accounts on such platforms claiming to be Omne are not me and may violate their platforms' rules on impersonation.
