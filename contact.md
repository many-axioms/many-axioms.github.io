# Contact

Please respect my time when reaching out. I prioritize self-improvement over engaging in trivial conversations. If I don't respond to you, there is a reason.

## Email

You can reach me at many-axioms at outlook dot com.

- If we're on good terms, I'll typically respond within a week.
- Otherwise, expect a response within a week, provided your email is interesting and of value.
- Responses may take up to a month if I am busy.
- Do not resend an email with identical content if I did not respond to your email, but you are welcome to try again with different content.
- If you're unsure about emailing, err on the side of sending.

## Instant messaging

Prior to the publication of this document, Discord was my primary method of contact. However, I intend to leave the platform entirely for several reasons, outlined below in no particular order:

- Discord restricts access to its official client, prohibiting third-party alternatives under its terms of service. In contrast, many communication platforms are based on interoperable open standards, offering users greater choice and flexibility.
- Discord collects extensive data, including users' IP addresses as well as the content of messages, files, and voice calls exchanged on the platform.
- Discord increasingly resembles conventional social media, particularly with an increasing abundance of features aimed at large communities. This shift sets the stage for [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), a degradation of user experience to maximize shareholder profit.
- Discordâ€™s reliance on investment capital for funding, combined with its expansive feature set, suggests it may struggle to meet financial obligations long-term. Given its extensive data collection, Discord is likely to sell user data for purposes like targeted advertising and AI training if other revenue strategies, such as Discord Nitro, fall short.

Instant messaging may be superior to email if we need to work together on something in real time. If instant messaging is strongly preferable, we can arrange a conversation on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), a decentralized instant messaging platform based on an open standard. I do not check Matrix outside of scheduled discussions.

## Social media

I do not have accounts on any mainstream social media platforms. Any accounts on such platforms claiming to be Omne are not me and may violate their platforms' rules on impersonation.
