# You are a neural network

An analogy between mental health and machine learning.

## Training
Neural networks are trained using hyperparameters and training data.

Neural networks can be trained with different hyperparameters and different training data.
Different combinations of these result in different neural networks, different locally optimal solutions.

Different locally optimal solutions may be more or less optimal compared with each other.

## Optima
Humans are trained using genetic hyperparameters and environmental training data.

Humans can be trained with different genetics and different environments.

Different combinations of these result in different humans, different locally optimal solutions.

Different locally optimal solutions may be more or less optimal compared with each other.

## Randomness
Find a more global optimum by adding randomness.

Machine learning has stochastic hill climbing, simulated annealing.

A mind can try new habits, new ways of thought.

## Conclusion
In machine learning, an insufficiently optimal local optimum is a spurious minimum.

In psychology, an insufficiently optimal local optimum is a mental disorder.

The challenge in both is to get to one of the best local optimums.

An accurate neural network.

A healthy mind.
